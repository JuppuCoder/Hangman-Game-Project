## How to play 
1. Start the Game:  Open the game in a web browser. The game will typically load in a new window or tab.
2. Guessing Letters:  Click on the letter keys displayed on the screen to guess the letters you think might be in the hidden word. Each time you click a letter, it will be displayed on the screen.
3. Correct Guesses:  If your guess is a correct letter, it will be filled in the blank spaces provided for the word being guessed. The number of blank spaces corresponds to the length of the hidden word.
4. Incorrect Guesses:  If your guess is an incorrect letter, an incorrect body part (e.g., head, torso, arms, legs) will be added to the hangman display. The number of wrong guesses allowed before the game ends depends on the difficulty level chosen (if applicable) or the default setting of the game.
5. Winning the Game:  You win the game if you can guess all the letters in the hidden word before the hangman display is complete (i.e., all body parts are added). The complete word will be revealed.
6. Losing the Game:  You lose the game if you make too many incorrect guesses and the hangman display is complete. The hidden word will be revealed.
